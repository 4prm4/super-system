    <h1>Johnny Jash</h1>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Example.png">
    <p>Johnny Jash is a singer-songwriter born in Mexico. Born in Chicago,he was born March 21, 1973 and worked as a producer for two years prior to
    graduating from the University of Illinois at Chicago. In the mid-'90s, after his final release, he wrote two songs. He
    then returned to Los Angeles for the first time in over thirty years, where he recorded six new album singles. Following
    his release, he re-envisioned the '70s in the form of Bambas. With the exception of the live sets that occurred in early
    '70s Los Angeles, Jash's work with these new acts was the same. His work is sometimes referred to as "Vinyl" sound as he
    sang about the '80s, even though the band featured Bambas' songs on most of the songs.
    
    However, he had to wait until his first recording after he was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma to work on his next
    record. This left him without his favorite songs for quite sometime until the song "Don't Give 'Em Up" came out. "Don't
    Give 'Em Up" is his favorite song. It was one of the first albums that Jash wrote for Pink Floyd, being inspired by
    their previous album "You Don't Know Us" with Jeff Lynne.
    
    The song was written for "Don't Give Me Up" which debuted at Number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 with a 1,531,539 lead
    single.</p>
